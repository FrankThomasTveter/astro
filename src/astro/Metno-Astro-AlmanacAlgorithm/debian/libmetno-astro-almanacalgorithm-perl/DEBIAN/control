Description: When does the sun rise and set for a given place?
 Given a position in longitude and latitude and date, send a simple request and
 find out when the sun and the moon rise and set.  The elevation angle of the sun at
 solar noon is also given. You can either specify a given date using the
 date parameter or you can ask for a range, using the parameters
 from and to (which both are inclusive).
 Note that the algorithm estimates the timezone based on longitude, and events
 around midnight can therefore be misplaced with respect to the local date.
 .
 Direct requests can also be sent to the underlying astronomical event library.
 This option is only recommended for advanced users.
 .
 The times are all in UTC. Coordinates are given with east and north as positive values.
